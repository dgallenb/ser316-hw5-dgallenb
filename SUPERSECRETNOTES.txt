Wow, someone's a cheater. Aight, so there are seven types.

Quartz: Tend to have chonky HP but are often slightly slower. Strong advantage against Onyx. Deals neutral damage to everything else. Everything else (except Onyx) deals slightly increased damage to Quartz.
Onyx: Rude little buggers. Strong advantage against everything but Quartz. Weak to Quartz.
Agate: Balanced on the whole. Strong advantage against Sapphire and Opal. Strong disadvantage against Topaz and Peridot.
Sapphire: Glass cannons. Strong advantage against Topaz and Peridot. 
Topaz: Slightly lower HP, raised other stats. Strong against Opal and Agate.
Opal: Offensive lean, slower than usual.Strong against Peridot and Sapphire.
Peridot: Slightly tanky. Strong against Agate and Topaz.

Every type has an associated weather that benefits it. Everyone but Onyx and Quartz deals less during an eclipse.

Every move has a type, a damage base (DB), and a frequency. If the move's type matches the user's type, it raises the DB. Most moves with higher DB have a lower frequency, so keep that in mind. Moves should always deal at least 1 damage, so fights should generally lean towards rocket tag than grindy nightmares. High DB doesn't guarantee higher damage, as an FYI, because there's some dice rolling involved.

Codemons tend to learn moves of their own type, when a move is chosen at random. 

Each codemon has four core stats: HP, attack, defense, speed. I hope you can figure out what each of these does in essence, if not the calculation.

Every day/night cycle advance, codemon will heal for a tick (10%) of HP. If you want other healing, rest or buy items from the shop.

Most of the numbers are based on PTU, so if you're wondering why it doesn't quite map to Pokemon, that's probably why.
